hypothesis: qacc is too high becuase position encoding
- clamping qvel doesn't even do anything (tested with using adhoc random events). annoying.
- mjpython mujoco viewer does not have the same problem -- qaccs aren't extremely large

- added tanh bijector
- also increase hidden layer sizes as getting close to end (similar to isasaclab)

- i think observations in infer_wrapper not being normalized across MULTIPLE environments might be problem

TODO:
- do delta from original position instead of velocity reward


bro.

its cheating velocity reward by just moving arms LOL -- better to stick to non-wrapper for now
